#summary Project S60's goal is to create a multifunction firmware editor and modder

= Project S60 =

Project S60 is the next generation of firmware editing. It not just lets you extract then repack your firmware, but even it contains a lot of extendability to let modders do what they want - in the easy way. With Project S60, there is no more need for browsing folders and trying to remember where you left a given mod - you can add it right to FEd (our firmware editor) and any time you want to use it, it will be always available.
Also, from other modders, our database will contain a lot of useful information and mod, so maybe you don't even have to make it for yourself!


= Details =

Currently we are working on the mainframe of Project S60. This will contain the editor (FEd), the Plugin interface for developing plugins, and a few Libraries for modders (SIS, Firmware, Imaging (SVG, MIF, MBM and bitmap management), and also a few example plugins.

Our biggest plugin currently is the Central Repository Editor (or CenRepEdit for short) what is a separate Library, with a plugin for [https://code.google.com/p/nokias60cenrepeditor/wiki/FEd FEd], and a standalone user interface too.
