# Project S60 #



Project S60 is the codename of ongoing firmware editing and modding tools by our little group.



With it's extendability and continuous development, Project S60's applications are built on the same frame, but works totally different.

If you want to edit firmwares in a professional way - choose FEd.
Or you just want to edit some extracted Central Repository file - you use CenRepEdit.

Sooner or later our work will cover most of the modifiable Symbian stuff, like theme effects, and other modding what you can imagine.

Our goal is to create an easy-to-use and easy-to-extend framework of S60 modding tools.
